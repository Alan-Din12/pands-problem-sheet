# About

<p> This is a marrkdown doccument to show the work I have completed during this course. I will explain each weekly task completed and show the code breakdown</p>

## Week 1 - Task 1

### helloWorld.py


<p> This task was all about getting used to python and writing our first piece of code to print "Hello World" </p>

> print("Hello world")

<p> The program will then run this code and you will end up with the following</p>

 > Hello World 

 ## Week 2 - Task 1
### bank.py

<p> This weeks task required me to create a python code to prompt the user to input two amounts of money. using the following code : 
</p>

>amount1 = int(input("Enter the first amount in cents: "))
>
>amount2 = int(input ("Enter the second amount in cents: "))

<p> Then a simple calculation was ran in the background to add these two amounts together. </p>

> sum (ammount 1 + ammount 2)

<p> To convert this into a decimal, we must let the computer know that it is an integer and then you must divide it by 100 </p>

> total = int(sum)/100

<p>Finally, the computer program will print your ammount in euro and cents </p>

> print (f"The sum of these is â‚¬{total}")
